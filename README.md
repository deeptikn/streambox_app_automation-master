I get error: 2014-05-19 23:07:13.199 instruments[30608:1207] Failed to start Instruments daemon for 'iOS' on 'iPhone (v7.1.1)' (The service is invalid.)

Instruments Trace Error : Error Starting Recording

```
When I got "Failed to start Instruments daemon" message, I opened Xcode, Window, Organizer and did nothing else.

Next, I  ran make test1 again.  This time I got message
```
2014-05-19 23:08:01.473 instruments[30660:1207] Permission to debug com.streambox.iphapp was denied.  The app must be signed with a development identity (e.g. iOS Developer).
```
which reminds me: I just now downloaded the newest Streambox App v3.0.14 from Apple store and I guess the Apple store versions are signed differently than by development builds.
